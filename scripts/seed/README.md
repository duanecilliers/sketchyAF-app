# Seed Scripts Directory

This directory contains seeding scripts for populating the SketchyAF database with test data.

## User Seeding Script

### Overview

The `seed-users.js` script allows you to create multiple users in your Supabase database from a JSON file. This is useful for:

- Setting up test users for development
- Populating the database with initial users
- Creating users with specific configurations

### Usage

1. **Create your seed data file:**
   ```bash
   cp scripts/seed/seed-users.example.json scripts/seed/seed-users.json
   ```

2. **Edit the seed data:**
   Edit `scripts/seed/seed-users.json` with your desired user data. The file structure should be:
   ```json
   {
     "users": [
       {
         "email": "user@example.com",
         "password": "password123",
         "username": "unique_username",
         "avatar_url": "https://example.com/avatar.jpg",
         "is_subscriber": false,
         "subscription_tier": "free"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   # Using npm script (recommended)
   npm run seed:users
   
   # Or directly with node
   node scripts/seed/seed-users.js
   ```

### Field Descriptions

- **email** (required): User's email address (must be unique)
- **password** (required): User's password for authentication
- **username** (required): Display username (must be unique)
- **avatar_url** (optional): URL to user's avatar image
- **is_subscriber** (optional): Boolean indicating if user has a subscription (default: false)
- **subscription_tier** (optional): Either "free" or "premium" (default: "free")

### Features

- **Validation**: Validates all user data before processing
- **Duplicate Detection**: Skips users that already exist in the database
- **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error messages for failed operations
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows progress and summary of operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Includes delays between user creation to avoid rate limits

### Security Notes

- The `scripts/seed/seed-users.json` file is automatically git-ignored to prevent committing sensitive data
- Uses Supabase service role key for admin operations
- Passwords are securely handled by Supabase Auth
- Email confirmation is automatically handled

### Example Output
