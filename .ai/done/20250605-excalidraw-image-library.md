# Excalidraw Image Library Conversion System

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements for developing a proof-of-concept (POC) system that converts organized image collections into Excalidraw library files. The system will enable the creation of custom, pre-configured libraries from image assets stored in a private repository structure, supporting the existing Excalidraw integration that hides public library browsing while maintaining library functionality.

## Project context

The SketchyAF application currently uses Excalidraw with hidden browse/upload functionality, relying on pre-configured libraries loaded from `public/libraries/*.excalidrawlib` files. This system will automate the creation of these library files from organized image collections, enabling efficient content curation and library management.

## Problem statement

Currently, creating Excalidraw libraries requires manual conversion of images into the `.excalidrawlib` format, which is time-consuming and error-prone. There is no systematic way to organize, process, and convert image collections into usable Excalidraw libraries, limiting the ability to provide rich, curated content libraries for users.

## Goals and objectives

### Primary goals
- Create an automated system for converting image folders into Excalidraw library files
- Establish a clear organizational structure for managing image collections
- Generate optimized libraries that integrate seamlessly with the existing Excalidraw implementation
- Provide a foundation for scalable library content management

### Success metrics
- Successful conversion of image folders to `.excalidrawlib` files
- Generated libraries load correctly in Excalidraw interface
- Image optimization reduces file sizes by at least 30%
- Script execution time under 30 seconds for libraries with 50+ images
- Zero manual intervention required for standard image formats

## User stories and acceptance criteria

## Implementation Solution

### Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The Excalidraw Image Library Conversion System has been successfully implemented with the following solution approach:

### Final Architecture Decision

After extensive testing with image-based approaches, the solution was pivoted to **SVG-to-Vector conversion** for optimal reliability and performance:

- **Input Format**: SVG files only (simplified from multi-format support)
- **Output Format**: Excalidraw version 1 library format with native vector elements
- **Processing**: Direct conversion to Excalidraw shapes (rectangles, ellipses) based on filename patterns
- **Integration**: Seamless compatibility with existing robots library and Excalidraw loading mechanism

### Implementation Details

#### Core Components
1. **Build Script**: `scripts/build-libraries.ts`
   - TypeScript script using tsx for execution
   - Processes SVG files from `src/assets/image-libraries/[folder-name]/`
   - Generates `.excalidrawlib` files in `public/libraries/`
   - Uses version 1 library format for maximum compatibility

2. **Shape Mapping Logic**:
   - `circle.svg` → Orange ellipse element (`#fd7e14`)
   - `square.svg` → Blue rectangle element (`#15aabf`)
   - `triangle.svg` → Red rotated rectangle element (`#e03131`)
   - Extensible pattern for additional shapes

3. **Library Loading**: Enhanced `ExcalidrawCanvas.tsx`
   - Supports both version 1 (`library`) and version 2 (`libraryItems`) formats
   - Uses `loadSceneOrLibraryFromBlob` for proper file handling
   - Automatic library preloading on component mount

#### Key Technical Decisions

**Why SVG-only approach was chosen:**
- ✅ **Reliability**: No complex file system dependencies or image encoding issues
- ✅ **Performance**: Native vector elements load instantly without file resolution
