## ðŸš¨ Risk Mitigation & Rollback Procedures

### **High-Risk Scenarios & Mitigation**

#### **1. Database Migration Failure**
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Pre-validate migrations in staging
- Maintain database backups before migration
- Test rollback procedures in staging

**Rollback Procedure** (< 10 minutes):
```sql
-- Rollback database migration
BEGIN;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS broadcast_game_event();
-- Restore previous function version
\i previous_function_backup.sql
COMMIT;
```

#### **2. Edge Function Deployment Issues**
**Risk Level**: Low
**Mitigation**:
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Automated health checks post-deployment
- Immediate rollback capability

**Rollback Procedure** (< 5 minutes):
```bash
# Rollback to previous Edge Function version
supabase functions deploy broadcast-pubnub-event@previous --project-ref production
supabase functions deploy monitor-game-timers@previous --project-ref production
```

#### **3. PubNub API Failures**
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Circuit breaker pattern implemented
- Graceful degradation to database-only updates
- Real-time monitoring of PubNub status

**Fallback Procedure**:
```bash
# Disable PubNub broadcasting temporarily
supabase secrets set ENABLE_PUBNUB_BROADCASTING=false --project-ref production
```

#### **4. Performance Degradation**
**Risk Level**: Medium
**Mitigation**:
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Automatic scaling triggers
- Load balancing configuration

**Response Procedure**:
```bash
# Reduce concurrency limits
supabase secrets set TIMER_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT=3 --project-ref production
supabase secrets set MAX_GAMES_PER_EXECUTION=25 --project-ref production
```

### **Emergency Rollback (Complete System)**
**Execution Time**: < 15 minutes
**Trigger Conditions**:
- Error rate > 10% for 5+ minutes
- System unavailability > 2 minutes
- Critical security vulnerability discovered

**Emergency Rollback Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Disable timer monitoring (2 minutes)
supabase functions unschedule monitor-game-timers --project-ref production

# 2. Disable database triggers (3 minutes)
psql "production-db-url" -c "
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS game_status_change_trigger ON games;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS game_participant_change_trigger ON game_participants;
"

# 3. Revert Edge Functions (5 minutes)
supabase functions deploy broadcast-pubnub-event@stable --project-ref production
supabase functions deploy monitor-game-timers@stable --project-ref production

# 4. Restore database functions (3 minutes)
psql "production-db-url" -f backup/stable_functions.sql

# 5. Re-enable with previous configuration (2 minutes)
supabase functions schedule monitor-game-timers --cron "*/10 * * * * *" --project-ref production
```
