```

### Core Database Function

The `monitor_game_timers_db()` function is the heart of the system:

```sql
-- Main timer monitoring function
SELECT * FROM monitor_game_timers_db();

-- Returns:
-- processed: Number of games transitioned
-- errors: Number of errors encountered  
-- skipped: Number of games skipped
-- execution_time_ms: Database execution time
-- result_timestamp: When the function completed
-- details: JSON with detailed game processing info
```

### Advisory Locking System

Prevents concurrent executions using enhanced advisory locks:

```sql
-- Enhanced advisory lock functions
SELECT acquire_advisory_lock_enhanced('monitor_game_timers', 60, 'cron_job');
SELECT release_advisory_lock_enhanced('monitor_game_timers');

-- Lock status monitoring
SELECT * FROM get_advisory_lock_status();
```

## Database Schema

### Timer Fields

```sql
-- Games table timer fields
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN current_phase_duration INTEGER;
ALTER TABLE games ADD COLUMN phase_expires_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;

-- Advisory lock metadata
CREATE TABLE advisory_lock_metadata (
  lock_key TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  acquired_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  acquired_by TEXT DEFAULT 'unknown',
  timeout_seconds INTEGER DEFAULT 300
);
```

### Performance Indexes

```sql
-- Critical indexes for timer monitoring performance
CREATE INDEX idx_games_timer_monitoring_v2 ON games(status, phase_expires_at) 
WHERE status IN ('briefing', 'drawing', 'voting') AND phase_expires_at IS NOT NULL;

CREATE INDEX idx_games_active_timers_v2 ON games(phase_expires_at, status, id) 
WHERE phase_expires_at IS NOT NULL AND status IN ('briefing', 'drawing', 'voting');
```

## PubNub Broadcasting Integration

### Database Triggers

Automatic PubNub broadcasting via database triggers:

```sql
-- Phase change trigger
CREATE TRIGGER trigger_broadcast_phase_change
  AFTER UPDATE OF status ON games
  FOR EACH ROW 
  WHEN (OLD.status IS DISTINCT FROM NEW.status)
  EXECUTE FUNCTION broadcast_game_event('phase_changed');
```

### Production vs Local Development

| Environment | Timer Execution | PubNub Broadcasting | Configuration |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Production** | Supabase Cron → `monitor_game_timers_db()` | Database triggers → `pg_net` → Edge Function | Automatic via `pg_net` |
| **Local Dev** | Script → `monitor_game_timers_db()` | Script → Direct Edge Function calls | Manual simulation |

## Game Phase Transitions

### Supported Transitions

```sql
-- Valid phase transitions
briefing → drawing   (after briefing timer expires)
drawing → voting     (after drawing timer expires or all players submit)
voting → completed   (after voting timer expires)
```

### Grace Period Handling

The system includes intelligent grace period handling for the drawing phase:

- **All players submitted**: Immediate transition to voting
- **Timer expired**: Transition with auto-submission for incomplete drawings
- **Grace period**: 10-second buffer for network delays
