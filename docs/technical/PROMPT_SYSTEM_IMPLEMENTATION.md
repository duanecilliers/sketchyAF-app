# SketchyAF Prompt System Implementation

## Overview

Successfully extracted and integrated 24 unique drawing prompts from the CSV file `SketchyAF_100_Social_Trend_Prompts.csv` into the SketchyAF game system. The prompts are now automatically used when creating new games through the matchmaking system.

## Implementation Details

### 1. CSV Processing and Extraction

**Script Created**: `scripts/extract-prompts.cjs`
- Parses the CSV file with proper handling of quoted fields and commas
- Extracts prompts from the `prompt_text` column (2nd column)
- Removes duplicates (100 CSV entries → 24 unique prompts)
- Cleans prompt text by removing "Draw a", "Draw", "Sketch a", "Sketch", "Illustrate a", "Illustrate" prefixes
- Capitalizes first letter and ensures proper punctuation

**Example Transformations**:
- `"Draw a delulu CEO arguing with a pigeon boardroom."` → `"Delulu CEO arguing with a pigeon boardroom."`
- `"Sketch a haunted vending machine that dispenses bad advice."` → `"Haunted vending machine that dispenses bad advice."`

### 2. Prompt Data File

**File Created**: `src/data/gamePrompts.ts`
- Contains `GAME_PROMPTS` array with 24 unique prompts
- Exports `getRandomPrompt()` function for single random selection
- Exports `getRandomPrompts(count)` function for multiple random selections without duplicates
- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Auto-generated with timestamp and source information

### 3. Integration with Game System

**Modified**: `src/services/MatchmakingService.ts`
- Added import for `getRandomPrompt` from the new prompt data file
- Updated `getRandomPrompt()` method to use the new prompt system instead of hardcoded prompts
- Removed old hardcoded prompt array (10 old prompts → 24 new social trend prompts)

### 4. Testing and Validation

**Script Created**: `scripts/test-prompt-system.cjs`
- Validates the prompt file structure and content
- Confirms all required functions are exported
- Verifies minimum prompt count and proper formatting
- Provides statistics and sample output

## Sample Prompts

The new prompt system includes engaging, social media-inspired prompts such as:

1. "Delulu CEO arguing with a pigeon boardroom."
2. "Haunted vending machine that dispenses bad advice."
3. "Depressed broccoli giving a weather forecast."
4. "Witch taking selfies in a pumpkin patch rave."
5. "Cottagecore witch riding a pastel vacuum."
6. "Smart fridge leading a protest against midnight snacks."
7. "Yoga influencer levitating on a pizza."
8. "Clowncore barista spilling existential tea."
9. "Someone going full delulu in a board meeting."
10. "Moon colony governed by cats in lab coats."

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
CSV File → extract-prompts.cjs → gamePrompts.ts → MatchmakingService → Game Creation
```

### Function Usage
```typescript
// Single random prompt
const prompt = getRandomPrompt();

// Multiple random prompts (no duplicates)
const prompts = getRandomPrompts(5);
```

### Integration Points
- **MatchmakingService**: Uses prompts when creating games for matched players
- **GameService**: Accepts prompts in `createGame()` function
- **UI Components**: Display prompts from `currentGame?.prompt`

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/data/gamePrompts.ts` - Main prompt data and functions
- `scripts/extract-prompts.cjs` - CSV extraction script
- `scripts/test-prompt-system.cjs` - Validation script
- `PROMPT_SYSTEM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files
- `src/services/MatchmakingService.ts` - Updated to use new prompt system

### Unchanged (Intentionally)
- Test scripts in `scripts/game/` - Keep hardcoded prompts for predictable testing
- Mock data files - Keep existing prompts for UI examples
- Game creation interfaces - No changes needed, still accepts prompt strings

## Verification Steps Completed

✅ **Build Test**: `npm run build` - Successful compilation  
✅ **Type Safety**: No TypeScript errors or warnings  
✅ **Function Export**: All required functions properly exported  
✅ **Prompt Count**: 24 unique prompts extracted from 100 CSV entries  
✅ **Format Validation**: Prompts properly cleaned and formatted  
✅ **Integration**: MatchmakingService successfully updated  

## Usage in Game Flow

1. **Player Joins Queue**: Via lobby screen or matchmaking
2. **Players Matched**: MatchmakingService finds compatible players
3. **Game Creation**: `createGameForMatchedPlayers()` calls `getRandomPrompt()`
4. **Random Selection**: One of 24 prompts is randomly selected
5. **Game Start**: Players see the prompt in pre-round briefing screen
6. **Drawing Phase**: Prompt displayed in drawing interface
7. **Voting Phase**: Prompt shown during voting

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation provides a solid foundation for future prompt management features:

- **Categories**: Group prompts by theme (meme-culture, aesthetic-chaos, absurd-reality)
- **Difficulty Levels**: Rate prompts by drawing complexity
- **User Preferences**: Allow players to select preferred prompt types
- **Dynamic Loading**: Fetch prompts from database instead of static file
- **Admin Interface**: Add/edit/remove prompts through admin panel
- **Analytics**: Track which prompts are most popular/successful
- **Seasonal Content**: Rotate prompts based on holidays or events

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Development Testing**:
   - Start local development server
   - Join matchmaking queue
   - Verify new prompts appear in created games
   - Check that different prompts are selected on multiple game creations

2. **UI Testing**:
   - Confirm prompts display correctly in pre-round briefing screen
   - Verify prompts show in drawing interface header
   - Check voting screen displays the prompt

3. **Randomization Testing**:
   - Create multiple games and verify different prompts are selected
   - Ensure no obvious patterns in prompt selection

## Success Metrics

- ✅ 24 unique, engaging prompts now available
- ✅ Zero hardcoded prompts in production game creation flow
- ✅ Seamless integration with existing game architecture
- ✅ Type-safe implementation with full TypeScript support
- ✅ Maintainable code structure for future enhancements
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and validation scripts
